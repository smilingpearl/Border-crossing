# Border-crossing
The movement of people and goods across U.S. land borders serves as a critical indicator of economic activity, national security, and regional connectivity. Analyzing monthly inbound crossing data enables the detection of long-term traffic trends, seasonal fluctuations, and disruptions caused by extraordinary events such as the COVID-19 pandemic or national holidays. These insights are essential for improving operational readiness, forecasting resource needs, and informing data-driven decisions in border management.
Transportation planners, government agencies, and policy researchers lack reliable, data-driven insights on how border traffic behaves over time, across regions, and through different transport modes. Government agencies, particularly transportation planners and policy analysts, face challenges in deriving actionable insights from raw border crossing data due to its volume and complexity. Despite the availability of administrative records, there is a lack of empirically grounded studies that quantify variations in border activity. Our project addresses that gap by applying descriptive and inferential statistical methods to publicly available data in order to uncover meaningful, actionable trends in inbound border crossings.
