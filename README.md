# Border-crossing
The movement of people and goods across U.S. land borders serves as a critical indicator of economic activity, national security, and regional connectivity. Analyzing monthly inbound crossing data enables the detection of long-term traffic trends, seasonal fluctuations, and disruptions caused by extraordinary events such as the COVID-19 pandemic or national holidays. These insights are essential for improving operational readiness, forecasting resource needs, and informing data-driven decisions in border management.
